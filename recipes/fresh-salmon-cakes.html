        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>This recipe is taken from Chef John (Mitzewich) of <a href="https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/239541/chef-johns-fresh-salmon-cakes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener norefferer">AllRecipes.com</a> 
        who describes salmon cakes as one of his "go to emergency meals".</p>
        <p>With a fairly simply preparation, it should be an easy addition to the cookbook for most. Advised to serve with 
        lemon wedge and remoulade sauce.</p>
